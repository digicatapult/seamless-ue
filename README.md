Unreal project for [SEAMless](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=10011940) - Subsea Enhanced Autonomous Mapping. An application that visualises 3D mapping to deliver the 'Google Maps' of subsea.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Unreal Engine 5.2](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
- [Cloud Compare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/) for `.ply` -> `.las` conversion, installed in the default folder (C:\Program Files\CloudCompare)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) api key

### Mapbox API
To use the mapping features you need a mapbox api key. 
Please create a file name "tokens.json" inside the "Other" folder. The file should contain your api key and be structured like this: 

`{
"mapbox":"yourKeyHere"
}`
